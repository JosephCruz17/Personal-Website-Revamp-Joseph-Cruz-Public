   <div><p> My name is Joseph Cruz. I am a rising senior at University Height Secondary school. I come from the Dominican Republic and belong to a family of 4. This summer I am attending a summer intensive program at All Star Code. I have always been deeply interested in the business and technology field. I plan to study Managment Information System with a minor in Business or Accounting. I am a quiet, discipline, hard-working person. I enjoy multitasking and challenging myself in the areas I enjoy. Some of my hobbies are: listening to music, playing video games, expending time with my family.
